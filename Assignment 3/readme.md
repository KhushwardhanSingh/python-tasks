Task 1: Factorial Calculator
This task implements a Python program to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The user is prompted to enter a number, and the program computes its factorial using a recursive function. If the input is negative, the program notifies the user that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.

Task 2: Mathematical Operations Calculator
This task implements a Python program that performs several mathematical operations on a user-provided number. The program calculates and displays the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the input number. It includes error handling for invalid inputs, such as negative numbers for square root and non-positive numbers for logarithm. The calculations use Pythonâ€™s built-in math module.
